# LoungeStats
Profitgraph for CSGOLounge and DOTA2Lounge

# What is this?
For more than a year i have been happily supporting, updating, and fixing bugs in LoungeStats, a Profit graph for CSGOLounge.com and DOTA2Lounge.com. While those bugs often where not caused by me, but rather by the Website being inconsitent as *!")(ยง", i still tried my best to keep up the support. You can see a history of that on the Userscript's subreddit: http://reddit.com/r/LoungeStats. Sadly, i do not have the time and dedication for that anymore though, and since i do not want this extension that has helped hundred thousands's of people to die my hope is that the community can help me with my mission.

# Stuff as of initial commit:
* The code is mostly uncommented and undocumented
* A lot of dirty hacks have been implemented, which may be hard to understand because of the above
* I commited every version that i have kept in my local history, hopefully that helps (a bit)

# Cool, i love LoungeStats, how can i help?
Are you good with JavaScript and especially Userscripts? Fork the repo, fix stuff, and send a PR my way. While my code is not the best in this case (*shit* to be exact), i kindly ask you to write *yours* cleanly, and leave comments. As mentioned before hardly anything is commented, so when you fight your way trough, please leave comments when you got how stuff works!
